        <h1>Privacy Policy for the YouTube Stream</h1>

        <p>The app, accessible from https://pentafrag.net/ytchat, has been developed to be as least intrustive as possible, to maintain the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by the app and how that data is used.</p>

        <p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to abuse me on Twitter (don't actually do that).</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the YouTube Streamchat Loader app and is valid for users of the app with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in its usage. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this specific URL.

        <h2>Consent</h2>

        <p>By using this app, and clicking the "Authenticate" button, you hereby consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>

        <h2>Information that is collected</h2>

        <p>This web application requests information from the Google/YouTube Data API V3 to retrieve the unique generated ID string for each broadcast on your YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>The only time that personal information is obtained is via Google's own login form/authentication prompt, which is a necessary to provide this tool access to what Google defines as "sensitive scope" information.</p>
        <p>When you click the "Authenticate" button, you are taken to a prompt that asks you for your Google Account and Password in order to authorise access to your API data.</p>

        <h2>How we use your information</h2>

        <p>The information that is retrieved from your approval is used explictly for the following reasons.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Automatically fetch the ID string for your YouTube broadcasts</li>
        <li>Add the fetched ID string to a URL to load into your browser to load that specific chat window of your YouTube livestream</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Beyond that, this app doesn't collect or store anything else - because I don't give a shit about the other garbage on your account.</p>

        <h2>Log Files</h2>

        <p>The server that hosts the application follows a standard procedure of using log files. These logs are used for troubleshooting purposes when something goes wrong with loading the app, what specific part of the code that failed, and the timestamp in the server's local time. The rest, as I mentioned earlier, I don't give a shit about.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>

        <p>In order to access the information from the YouTube Data API V3 resource, Google requires users to log in to their Google account, which creates a cookie on your local machine with some of that login data. The part that is used by this website specifically is a unique code, that is generated on authentication and expires when the window is closed, to then be traded for token to use the site.</p>

        <p>If you're able to make sense of it, the entire process is available to be viewed publicly in Google's OAuth 2.0 documentation.</p>

        <h2>Advertising Partners Privacy Policies</h2>

        <P>There are no advertisements on this application, server, or website.</p>

        <h2>Third Party Privacy Policies</h2>

        <p>The Privacy Policy of this app does not apply to other advertisers or websites. Thus, it is understood that you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information. It may include their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain options. </p>

        <p>You can choose to disable cookies through your individual browser options. Please note, that by doing so you'll break the functionality of the app.</p>
            
        <p>To know more detailed information about cookie management with specific web browsers, it can be found at the browsers' respective websites.</p>

        <h2>CCPA Privacy Rights (Do Not Sell My Personal Information)</h2>

        <p>Under the CCPA, among other rights, California consumers have the right to:</p>
        <p>Request that a business that collects a consumer's personal data disclose the categories and specific pieces of personal data that a business has collected about consumers.</p>
        <p>Request that a business delete any personal data about the consumer that a business has collected.</p>
        <p>Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data.</p>
        <p>If you make a request, a response must be provided within one calendar month. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact me.</p>

        <p>But as I'm not collecting any of this like Pokemon cards, this shouldn't be needed.</p>

        <h2>GDPR Data Protection Rights</h2>

        <p>We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following:</p>

        <p>Again, as I'm not collecting any of this like Pokemon cards, this shouldn't be needed.</p>
